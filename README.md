## Functionality

* Desktop Layout:
    * Fully functional tic tac toe game.
    * Layout responsiveness for small and large screens.

* Game Play:
    * Alternates between player 1 & player 2.
    * Message indicating the players turn.
    * Determines win or draw. Message indicates which player won the game
    * Tracks and renders count for each player.
    * TBD
    * Game automatically reset after 20 seconds.

* Local Storage:
    * Automatically saves win, retrieves and renders win count from local storage.
    * Automatically saves game history and displays wins for each player.

* Future Enhancements:
    * Allow players to pick or add a token.
    * Provide functionality to allow user to determine which player goes first.
    * Provide functionality to reset a game and/or clear win count/history.
    * All for multiple players beyond a two person game.
